Despite Singapore having the second highest credit card penetration rate in Asia Pacific, credit cards
in circulation are increasingly declining. This is not only a trend from the macro-perspective of the
nation, but also reflects a reduction in the average number of credit cards a Singaporean owns.
OCBC has rich credit card data and excellent reputation. However, competitive market campaigns by
companies worldwide, means OCBC needs to know more about their customers, to ensure retaining
their valuable customers. At the same time, OCBC analysts needs to balance the revenue and the
risk. </br>
The bottlenecks OCBC faced now are how to identify the valuable customers and what effective
measures should be taken to reach them.
We want to find out the most valuable customers based on the 80/20 rule, which small percentage
of the overall population contributes more than half the transaction amounts and who are the
revolver customers to extract more revenue from in the long run.
In order to retain these customers and generate more revenue for the bank, we want to find out the
profiles of them and do marketing targeted promotions.
